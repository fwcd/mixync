# Mixync

A small CLI tool for copying a Mixxx database along with tracks to and from a portable folder (`*.mixxxlib`) for archival, storage on a flash drive, a web server, etc.

A portable `*.mixxxlib` as generated by `mixync` has the following format:

```
my-library.mixxxlib
- mixxxdb.sqlite3    <- Mixxx database, but with portable paths
- folder1            <- Exported music folder
  - track1.mp3
  - track2.mp3
    ...
- folder2            <- Exported music folder
  - track1.mp3
  - track2.mp3
    ...
```
